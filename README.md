### Introduction

    This is my 2nd attempt at building a website. I am doing this particular project for a colleague forming part of my learning process. I was inspired by someone very special to me, who introduced me to the coding world of Full Stack Development.  This motivated me to attempt building my very first website and beginning my journey in Full Stack Development. However my first project was put on hold for a while so that I may accommodate my colleague’s needs.
    Although it was very overwhelming and difficult, as well as very challenging, the sheer pleasure of seeing my site slowly coming together is exhilarating. Every step good or bad was and still is a new learning experience.
    Using the principles of UX design, this fully responsive website was developed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, some javascript and the help with some youtube videos.
    With this project is completed it will be hosted by a hosting company of my colleague's choice.

### Goal

## Reviews and Wishlist

## Design

- Colour Scheme

The website uses the colours with a clean and soft approach for a healing and a peaceful effect.

- Colour Palette - Coolers.co

## Typography

The website uses three fonts from Google Fonts.

- The first one is called Lato, chosen for its semi-rounded details of the letters which give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness.  
  Lato is also a sans serif typeface family.

- The second font is called Merriweather, chosen because it is designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on screens . It has a fall back font version of 'serif'.

- Merriweather Sans, is a low-contrast semi-condensed sans-serif text typeface family designed to be pleasant to read at very small sizes.

These fonts have been chosen and is used throughout the website with sans-serif as fallback fonts in a case for any reason, the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The rounded and dynamic font was chosen to reflect femininity and a dynamic connection aspect to the site.

## Languages Used

    * HTML5
    * CSS3

## Imagery

- The icons in the site were taken from font-awesome and used for their obvious meaning.

- The logo was designed and created by Dr Janique Belli, Chiropractor, and owner of _*“The Chiro Wellness Connection”*_.

- The first image (on the home page) of the site was chosen as a background for the Title. It is an office view of the practice. This image was chosen as it captures the true essence of tranquillity of the practice ensuring a safe and peaceful experience.

- All photographs on the website _*“The Chiro Wellness Connection”*_, were taken by Tyrone Noble of Noble Media Solutions
